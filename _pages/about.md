I am a Chilean astrophysicist currently pursuing my PhD at the [Institut de Ciencies de l'Espai (ICE, CSIC)](https://www.ice.csic.es/) in Barcelona, where I work alongside Prof. [Anaelle Maury](https://irfu.cea.fr/Pisp/anaelle.maury/Welcome.html).

My background is in gas kinematics in protoplanetary disks. I earned my Master's degree from [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), focusing on the kinematics of warped protoplanetary disks under the supervision of Prof. [Til Birnstiel](https://www.physik.lmu.de/observatory/en/research/stars-planets-and-life/planet-formation-and-protoplanetary-disks/index.html) and Prof. [Richard Teague](https://github.com/richteague). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree at [University of Chile](https://das.uchile.cl/).
